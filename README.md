# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description
This project is a quiz on JavaScript made with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The motivation for this project was to learn how to use JavaScript to make a functional game that displays questions, and saves the user's score and submitted initials at the end of the quiz. While making this quiz, I learned how to use a number of different JavaScript concepts.
